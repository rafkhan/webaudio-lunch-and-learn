# AudioContext

The AudioContext interface represents an audio-processing graph built from audio modules linked together, each represented by an AudioNode. An audio context controls both the creation of the nodes it contains and the execution of the audio processing, or decoding. You need to create an AudioContext before you do anything else, as everything happens inside a context.

# AudioNode

The AudioNode interface is a generic interface for representing an audio processing module like an audio source (e.g. an HTML <audio> or <video> element, an OscillatorNode, etc.), the audio destination, intermediate processing module (e.g. a filter like BiquadFilterNode or ConvolverNode), or volume control (like GainNode).

# AudioNode

An AudioNode has inputs and outputs, each with a given amount of channels. An AudioNode with zero inputs and one or multiple outputs is called a source node. The exactly processing done varies from one AudioNode to another but, in general, a node reads its inputs, does some audio-related processing, and generates new values for its outputs,
